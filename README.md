Brahmavidya -
The Supreme Science.
Seeking knowledge of the underlying reality.

Everything already exists. We just need to discover it.

The Perennial Philosophy - 
There is an infinite changeless reality beneath the world of change.
The same reality lies at the core of every human personality.
The purpose of life is to discover this reality experientially.
